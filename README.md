# Middleware and Runners

The middleware components to enable flexile validation on client or server js environments.

## TODO

Other -mw projects) should reference this basic middleware functionality

The middleware index and config files should be removed... ??

The model-runner should be moved to model-mw project

Convert all files to LiveScript !!

## Middleware

The middlewares are currently split into Runner and -Mw components.

The idea is that a mw-runner can be defined (using base-runner as the "base") and will run a list of middlewares (-mw)
in succession.
